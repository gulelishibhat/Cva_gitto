Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Air BnB Seattle data of 2016.
How the number of host listings vary with the price, with  months and host response time?
How the number of listings vary with the host response rate?
What is the factor playing role in delaying the respone of the host?


File Descriptions

I have uploaded two files one wrangling the data and other one with the code.
There is an additional .py file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict host_response_time.

Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to AirBnb for the data. The data is available in the kaggle.
